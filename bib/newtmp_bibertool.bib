  ABSTRACT = {A transcript analysis of the citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase genes (gltA-sdhCDAB) of Escherichia coli was done by nuclease S1 mapping. Evidence was obtained for two monocistronic gltA transcripts extending anti-clockwise, to a common terminus, from independent promoters with start points 196 bp (major) and 299 bp (minor) upstream of the gltA coding region. Evidence was also obtained for two polycistronic sdh transcripts, sdhCDAB (minor) and sdhDAB (major), extending clockwise, from sites 219 bp upstream of sdhC and 1455 bp upstream of sdhD (i.e. within sdhC), to a common terminus. The synthesis of all of the transcripts was repressed by growth in the presence of glucose, and this is consistent with the well-established fact that both enzymes are subject to catabolite repression. Sequences resembling known binding sites for the cAMP-CRP (cyclic AMP-cyclicAMP receptor protein) complex occur in the vicinity of each promoter suggesting that they are activated by the cAMP-CRP complex.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Computational de novo discovery of transcription factor binding sites is still a challenging problem. The growing number of sequenced genomes allows integrating orthology evidence with coregulation information when searching for motifs. Moreover, the more advanced motif detection algorithms explicitly model the phylogenetic relatedness between the orthologous input sequences and thus should be well adapted towards using orthologous information. In this study, we evaluated the conditions under which complementing coregulation with orthologous information improves motif detection for the class of probabilistic motif detection algorithms with an explicit evolutionary model. METHODOLOGY: We designed datasets (real and synthetic) covering different degrees of coregulation and orthologous information to test how well Phylogibbs and Phylogenetic sampler, as representatives of the motif detection algorithms with evolutionary model performed as compared to MEME, a more classical motif detection algorithm that treats orthologs independently. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Under certain conditions detecting motifs in the combined coregulation-orthology space is indeed more efficient than using each space separately, but this is not always the case. Moreover, the difference in success rate between the advanced algorithms and MEME is still marginal. The success rate of motif detection depends on the complex interplay between the added information and the specificities of the applied algorithms. Insights in this relation provide information useful to both developers and users. All benchmark datasets are available at http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/\~{}kmarchal/Supplementary\_Storms\_Valerie\_PlosONE.},

@ARTICLE{Touati2000,
  ABSTRACT    = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced as an inescapable consequence of aerobic life. Their levels are kept low enough to be harmless by specific enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, which eliminate them. Expression of these defence enzymes is modulated depending on the environmental oxidative threat. This basic protection, however, is not sufficient to protect against sudden large increases in ROS production. To cope with oxidative stress, rapid global responses are induced that enable bacteria to survive the stress period by multiple means: elimination of ROS, repair of oxidative damage, bypass of damaged functions and induction of adapted metabolism. The soxRS response, which protects against superoxide (O2.-)-generating agents and nitric oxide (.NO), is triggered by activation of a sensor molecule, SoxR, containing two essential [2Fe-2S] clusters. The soxRS regulon is induced in a two-stage process. Upon activation, SoxR induces soxS expression and SoxS, in turn, activates transcription of genes of the regulon. The mechanism of signalling has been under debate for years. Evidence for several pathways of SoxR activation, mediated by the modifications of [2Fe-2S] centres, has emerged from recent data. The direct oxidation of [2Fe-2S] centres, any event that may interfere with the pathway maintaining SoxR in a reduced inactive form, and direct nitrosylation by .NO can trigger SoxR activation. The multiple possibilities for SoxR activation, along with signal amplification via the two-stage process, constitute a unique, and particularly sensitive, system enabling cells to induce rapidly a protective response to a broad range of environmental changes indicative of possible oxidative stress.},

  ABSTRACT = {We examined the genomewide transcriptional responses of Escherichia coli treated with nitrosylated glutathione or the nitric oxide (NO)-generator acidified sodium nitrite (NaNO(2)) during aerobic growth. These assays showed that NorR, a homolog of NO-responsive transcription factors in Ralstonia eutrophus, and Fur, the global repressor of ferric ion uptake, are major regulators of the response to reactive nitrogen species. In contrast, SoxR and OxyR, regulators of the E. coli defenses against superoxide-generating compounds and hydrogen peroxide, respectively, have minor roles. Moreover, additional regulators of the E. coli response to reactive nitrogen species remain to be identified because several of the induced genes were regulated normally in norR, fur, soxRS, and oxyR mutant strains. We propose that the E. coli transcriptional response to reactive nitrogen species is a composite response mediated by the modification of multiple transcription factors containing iron or redox-active cysteines, some specifically designed to sense NO and its derivatives and others that are collaterally activated by the reactive nitrogen species.},

  ABSTRACT = {The succinyl-CoA synthetase of Escherichia coli is encoded by two genes, sucC (beta subunit) and sucD (alpha subunit), which are distal genes in the sucABCD operon. They are expressed from the suc promoter, which also expresses the dehydrogenase and dihydrolipoyl succinyl-transferase subunits of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Strategies have now been devised for the site-directed mutagenesis and independent expression of the succinyl-CoA synthetase (alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer) and the individual subunits. These involve (1) subcloning a promoterless sucCD fragment downstream of the lac promoter in M13mp10, and (2) precise splicing of the suc coding regions with the efficient atpE ribosome-binding site and expression from the thermoinducible lambda promoters in the pJLA503 vector. Succinyl-CoA synthetase specific activities were amplified 40-60-fold within 5 h of thermoinduction of the lambda promoters, and the alpha and beta subunits accounted for almost 30\% of the protein in supernatant fractions of the cell-free extracts. Site-directed mutagenesis of potential CoA binding-site residues indicated that Trp-43 beta and His-50 beta are essential residues in the beta-subunit, whereas Cys-47 beta could be replaced by serine without inactivating the enzyme. No activity was detected after the histidine residue at the phosphorylation site of the alpha-subunit was replaced by aspartate (His-246 alpha----Asp), but this alteration seemed to have a deleterious effect on the accumulation of the enzyme in cell-free supernatant extracts. The nucleotide sequence of an unidentified gene (g30) that is adjacent to the sucABCD operon was defined by extending the sequence of the citric acid cycle gene cluster by 818 bp to 13379 bp: gltA-sdhCDAB-sucABCD-g30. This gene converges on the suc operon and encodes a product (P30) that contains 230 amino acids (Mr 27,251). Highly significant similarities were detected between the N-terminal region of P30 and those of GENA [the product of another unidentified gene (geneA) located upstream of the aceEF-lpd operon], and GNTR (a putative transcriptional repressor of the gluconate operon of Bacillus subtilis). Possible roles for GENA and P30 as transcriptional regulators of the adjacent operons encoding the pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes are discussed.},

  ABSTRACT    = {The availability of completely sequenced genomes and the wealth of literature on gene regulation have enabled researchers to model the transcriptional regulation system of some organisms in the form of a network. In order to reconstruct such networks in non-model organisms, three principal approaches have been taken. First, one can transfer the interactions between homologous components from a model organism to the organism of interest. Second, microarray experiments can be used to detect patterns in gene expression that stem from regulatory interactions. Finally, knowledge of experimentally characterized transcription factor binding sites can be used to analyze the promoter sequences in a genome in order to identify potential binding sites. In this chapter, we will focus in detail on the first approach and describe methods to reconstruct and analyze the transcriptional regulatory networks of uncharacterized organisms by using a known regulatory network as a template.},

  ABSTRACT = {Machine learning approaches offer the potential to systematically identify transcriptional regulatory interactions from a compendium of microarray expression profiles. However, experimental validation of the performance of these methods at the genome scale has remained elusive. Here we assess the global performance of four existing classes of inference algorithms using 445 Escherichia coli Affymetrix arrays and 3,216 known E. coli regulatory interactions from RegulonDB. We also developed and applied the context likelihood of relatedness (CLR) algorithm, a novel extension of the relevance networks class of algorithms. CLR demonstrates an average precision gain of 36\% relative to the next-best performing algorithm. At a 60\% true positive rate, CLR identifies 1,079 regulatory interactions, of which 338 were in the previously known network and 741 were novel predictions. We tested the predicted interactions for three transcription factors with chromatin immunoprecipitation, confirming 21 novel interactions and verifying our RegulonDB-based performance estimates. CLR also identified a regulatory link providing central metabolic control of iron transport, which we confirmed with real-time quantitative PCR. The compendium of expression data compiled in this study, coupled with RegulonDB, provides a valuable model system for further improvement of network inference algorithms using experimental data.},

  ABSTRACT    = {Manganese superoxide dismutase (the sodA gene product) in Escherichia coli, is negatively regulated by two global regulators, ArcA (aerobic respiration control) and Fur (ferric uptake regulation), coupling its expression to aerobic metabolism and the intracellular iron pool. Footprinting analyses were carried out on the sodA promoter region with purified Fur protein and with ArcA protein overproduced in crude extracts. ArcA is able to bind in vitro in the absence of the in vivo triggering signal. The binding occurs in one step and study of contacts within the operator sequence reveals binding on one side of the double helix. The DNA protection extends to a much larger region (about 65 bp) than would be expected for a 27 kDa protein, suggesting polymerization. Both Fur and ArcA footprints encompass the -35 and -10 promoter region and there is considerable overlap of their binding sequences, in agreement with in vivo results suggesting that either regulator alone can block sodA transcription. Furthermore, competition experiments show that Fur and ArcA binding to the sodA promoter are mutually exclusive and that ArcA can easily displace Fur, but not vice versa. The biological significance of this in vitro behaviour is discussed.},

  ABSTRACT    = {In Escherichia coli K-12, transcription of zwf, the gene for glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, is subject to growth rate-dependent regulation and is activated by SoxS in response to superoxide stress. To define genetically the site of SoxS activation, we undertook a detailed deletion analysis of the zwf promoter region. Using specifically targeted 5' and 3' deletions of zwf sequences, we localized the SoxS activation site to a 21-bp region upstream of the zwf promoter. This minimal "soxbox" was able to confer paraquat inducibility when placed upstream of a normally unresponsive gnd-lacZ protein fusion. In addition, we used these findings as the basis for resecting unnecessary sequences from the region upstream of the promoters of two other SoxS-regulated genes, sodA and nfo. Like the zwf soxbox, the regions required for SoxS activation of sodA and nfo appear to lie just upstream or overlap the -35 hexamers of the corresponding promoters. Importantly, the sequence boundaries established here by deletion analysis agree with the primary SoxS recognition sites of zwf, sodA, and nfo that we previously identified in vitro by gel mobility shift and DNase I protection assays with a purified MalE-SoxS fusion protein.},

  ABSTRACT = {A central issue in molecular biology is understanding the regulatory mechanisms that control gene expression. The availability of whole genome sequences opens the way for computational methods to search for the key elements in transcription regulation. These include methods for discovering the binding sites of DNA-binding proteins, such as transcription factors. A common representation of transcription factor binding sites is a position specific score matrix (PSSM). We developed a probabilistic approach for searching for putative binding sites. Given a promoter sequence and a PSSM, we scan the promoter and find the position with the maximal score. Then we calculate the probability to get such a maximal score or higher on a random promoter. This is the p-value of the putative binding site. In this way, we searched for putative binding sites in the upstream sequences of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where some binding sites are known (according to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Promoters Database, SCPD). Our method produces either exact p-values, or a better estimate for them than other methods, and this improves the results of the search. For each gene we found its statistically significant putative binding sites. We measured the rates of true positives, by a comparison to the known binding sites, and also compared our results to these of MatInspector, a commercially available software that looks for putative binding sites in DNA sequences according to PSSMs. Our results were significantly better. In contrast with us, MatInspector doesn't calculate the exact statistical significance of its results.},

  ABSTRACT    = {The individual and the combined effect of the fnr and arcA regulatory gene products on cytochrome o oxidase and cytochrome d oxidase gene expression in Escherichia coli were evaluated using lacZ reporter fusions to the cyo-ABCDE and cydAB operons. Fnr repressed cyo-lacZ and cyd-lacZ expression during anaerobic growth but not during aerobic growth conditions. ArcA functioned as an anaerobic repressor of cyo-lacZ expression while, in contrast, it activated cydAB expression during both aerobic and anaerobic growth. ArcA and Fnr appear to function independently of each other to control cyo-ABCDE operon expression. In contrast, FNR repression of cydAB expression was dependent on arcA+, as indicated by the inability of fnr+ plasmids to repress cyd-lacZ expression in an arcA strain. Under no conditions tested did Fnr activate cydAB expression. Most, but not all, of the observed aerobic/anaerobic regulation of cyo and cyd was accounted for by the two transcriptional regulators. These data suggest the existence of additional levels of anaerobic gene control in E. coli. Additionally, the expression of the fnr regulatory gene, and regulation of the anaerobic respiratory genes, narGHJI, dmsABC and frdABCD, was found to be independent of ArcA.},

  ABSTRACT    = {The ArcA and Fnr regulators of Escherichia coli, both of which are activated in anaerobic conditions, negatively regulate the sodA gene (coding for manganese superoxide dismutase), but Fnr has no effect on anaerobic sodA expression in a delta arcA delta fnr background (Compan and Touati, 1993). We show here that the sdh gene (coding for succinate dehydrogenase) is also negatively regulated by Fnr, but again Fnr exerts no control in a delta arcA background. One interpretation of these results is that Fnr activates arcA transcription. Using arcA-lac transcriptional and translational fusions, we show that arcA expression increases (about fourfold) in anaerobiosis and that both Fnr and ArcA are required for full expression. In a delta fnr background, there is no autoactivation, suggesting that ArcA enhances activation by Fnr. Transcript and sequence analyses reveal that the arcA upstream regulatory region lies within a 530 bp non-coding DNA fragment, which contains five putative promoter sequences and a putative Fnr-binding site. Identification of the transcription start sites indicates that transcription occurs in aerobiosis from three constitutive upstream promoters (Pe, Pd, Pc). In anaerobiosis an additional completely Fnr-dependent transcript starting at Pa is present; expression from Pa is reduced in the absence of ArcA, and Fnr activation at Pa blocks the weak anaerobic-dependent expression from Pb. Fnr activation of arcA transcription may play an important role in the co-ordination of expression of genes associated with aerobic and anaerobic metabolism during environmental changes.},

  ABSTRACT = {While Escherichia coli has one of the most comprehensive datasets of experimentally verified transcriptional regulatory interactions of any organism, it is still far from complete. This presents a problem when trying to combine gene expression and regulatory interactions to model transcriptional regulatory networks. Using the available regulatory interactions to predict new interactions may lead to better coverage and more accurate models. Here, we develop SEREND (SEmi-supervised REgulatory Network Discoverer), a semi-supervised learning method that uses a curated database of verified transcriptional factor-gene interactions, DNA sequence binding motifs, and a compendium of gene expression data in order to make thousands of new predictions about transcription factor-gene interactions, including whether the transcription factor activates or represses the gene. Using genome-wide binding datasets for several transcription factors, we demonstrate that our semi-supervised classification strategy improves the prediction of targets for a given transcription factor. To further demonstrate the utility of our inferred interactions, we generated a new microarray gene expression dataset for the aerobic to anaerobic shift response in E. coli. We used our inferred interactions with the verified interactions to reconstruct a dynamic regulatory network for this response. The network reconstructed when using our inferred interactions was better able to correctly identify known regulators and suggested additional activators and repressors as having important roles during the aerobic-anaerobic shift interface.},
