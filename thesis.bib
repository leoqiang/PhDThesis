  ABSTRACT  = {Personalized medicine is expected to benefit from combining 
  genomic information with regular monitoring of physiological states by 
  multiple high-throughput methods. Here, we present an integrative personal 
  omics profile (iPOP), an analysis that combines genomic, transcriptomic, 
  proteomic, metabolomic, and autoantibody profiles from a single individual 
  over a 14 month period. Our iPOP analysis revealed various medical risks, 
  including type 2 diabetes. It also uncovered extensive, dynamic changes in 
  diverse molecular components and biological pathways across healthy and 
  diseased conditions. Extremely high-coverage genomic and transcriptomic data, 
  which provide the basis of our iPOP, revealed extensive heteroallelic changes 
  during healthy and diseased states and an unexpected RNA editing mechanism. 
  This study demonstrates that longitudinal iPOP can be used to interpret 
  healthy and diseased states by connecting genomic information with additional 
  dynamic omics activity.},

  ABSTRACT = {Changes in the patterns of gene expression are widely believed to 
  underlie many of the phenotypic differences within and between species. 
  Although much emphasis has been placed on changes in transcriptional 
  regulation, gene expression is regulated at many levels, all of which must 
  ultimately be studied together to obtain a complete picture of the evolution 
  of gene expression. Here we compare the evolution of transcriptional 
  regulation and post-transcriptional regulation that is mediated by microRNAs, 
  a large class of small, non-coding RNAs in plants and animals, focusing on 
  the evolution of the individual regulators and their binding sites. As an 
  initial step towards integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, 
  we propose a simple model that describes the transcriptional regulation of 
  new microRNA genes.},

  ABSTRACT  = {BACKGROUND: Publicly available expression compendia that measure 
  both mRNAs and sRNAs provide a promising resource to simultaneously infer the 
  transcriptional and the posttranscriptional network. To maximally exploit the 
  information contained in such compendia, we propose an analysis flow that 
  combines publicly available expression compendia and sequence-based 
  predictions to infer novel sRNA-target interactions and to reconstruct the 
  relation between the sRNA and the transcriptional network. RESULTS: We relied 
  on module inference to construct modules of coexpressed genes (sRNAs). TFs 
  and sRNAs were assigned to these modules using the state-of-the-art inference 
  techniques LeMoNe and Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR). Combining 
  these expressions with sequence-based sRNA-target interactions allowed us to 
  predict 30 novel sRNA-target interactions comprising 14 sRNAs. Our results 
  highlight the role of the posttranscriptional network in finetuning the 
  transcriptional regulation, e.g. by intra-operonic regulation. CONCLUSION: In 
  this work we show how strategies that combine expression information with 
  sequence-based predictions can help unveiling the intricate interaction 
  between the transcriptional and the posttranscriptional network in 
  prokaryotic model systems.},

  ABSTRACT = {With the fast development of high-throughput sequencing 
  technologies, a new generation of genome-wide gene expression measurements is 
  under way. This is based on mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which complements the 
  already mature technology of microarrays, and is expected to overcome some of 
  the latter's disadvantages. These RNA-seq data pose new challenges, however, 
  as strengths and weaknesses have yet to be fully identified. Ideally, Next 
  (or Second) Generation Sequencing measures can be integrated for more 
  comprehensive gene expression investigation to facilitate analysis of whole 
  regulatory networks. At present, however, the nature of these data is not 
  very well understood. In this paper we study three alternative gene 
  expression time series datasets for the Drosophila melanogaster embryo 
  development, in order to compare three measurement techniques: RNA-seq, 
  single-channel and dual-channel microarrays. The aim is to study the state of 
  the art for the three technologies, with a view of assessing overlapping 
  features, data compatibility and integration potential, in the context of 
  time series measurements. This involves using established tools for each of 
  the three different technologies, and technical and biological replicates 
  (for RNA-seq and microarrays, respectively), due to the limited availability 
  of biological RNA-seq replicates for time series data. The approach consists 
  of a sensitivity analysis for differential expression and clustering. In 
  general, the RNA-seq dataset displayed highest sensitivity to differential 
  expression. The single-channel data performed similarly for the 
  differentially expressed genes common to gene sets considered. Cluster 
  analysis was used to identify different features of the gene space for the 
  three datasets, with higher similarities found for the RNA-seq and 
  single-channel microarray dataset.},

  ABSTRACT = {Comparing genomic properties of different organisms is of 
  fundamental importance in the study of biological and evolutionary 
  principles. Although differences among organisms are often attributed to 
  differential gene expression, genome-wide comparative analysis thus far has 
  been based primarily on genomic sequence information. We present a 
  comparative study of large datasets of expression profiles from six 
  evolutionarily distant organisms: S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, E. coli, A. 
  thaliana, D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens. We use genomic sequence 
  information to connect these data and compare global and modular properties 
  of the transcription programs. Linking genes whose expression profiles are 
  similar, we find that for all organisms the connectivity distribution follows 
  a power-law, highly connected genes tend to be essential and conserved, and 
  the expression program is highly modular. We reveal the modular structure by 
  decomposing each set of expression data into coexpressed modules. 
  Functionally related sets of genes are frequently coexpressed in multiple 
  organisms. Yet their relative importance to the transcription program and 
  their regulatory relationships vary among organisms. Our results demonstrate 
  the potential of combining sequence and expression data for improving 
  functional gene annotation and expanding our understanding of how gene 
  expression and diversity evolved.},

  ABSTRACT    = {Ultra-high-throughput sequencing is emerging as an attractive 
  alternative to microarrays for genotyping, analysis of methylation patterns, 
  and identification of transcription factor binding sites. Here, we describe 
  an application of the Illumina sequencing (formerly Solexa sequencing) 
  platform to study mRNA expression levels. Our goals were to estimate 
  technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to 
  compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing 
  array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences 
  between liver and kidney RNA samples using multiple sequencing replicates, 
  and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays 
  using the same RNA samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are 
  highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for 
  many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA sample only once (i.e., 
  using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data 
  appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of 
  differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such 
  as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel 
  transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol and 
  a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using 
  ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for new prognostic markers of 
  breast cancer metastases to ensure that newly diagnosed patients receive 
  appropriate therapy. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential value of 
  gene expression signatures in assessing the risk of developing distant 
  metastases. However, due to the small sample sizes of individual studies, the 
  overlap among signatures is almost zero and their predictive power is often 
  limited. Integrating microarray data from multiple studies in order to 
  increase sample size is therefore a promising approach to the development of 
  more robust prognostic tests. RESULTS: In this study, by using a highly 
  stable data aggregation procedure based on expression comparisons, we have 
  integrated three independent microarray gene expression data sets for breast 
  cancer and identified a structured prognostic signature consisting of 112 
  genes organized into 80 pair-wise expression comparisons. A classical 
  likelihood ratio test based on these comparisons, essentially weighted 
  voting, achieves 88.6\% sensitivity and 54.6\% specificity in an independent 
  external test set of 154 samples. The test is highly informative in assessing 
  the risk of developing distant metastases within five years (hazard ratio 9.3 
  with 95\% CI 2.9-29.9). CONCLUSION: Rank-based features provide a stable way 
  to integrate patient data from separate microarray studies due to invariance 
  to data normalization, and such features can be combined into a useful 
  predictor of distant metastases in breast cancer within a statistical 
  modeling framework which begins to capture gene-gene interactions. Upon 
  further confirmation on large-scale independent data, such prognostic 
  signatures and tests could provide a powerful tool to guide adjuvant systemic 
  treatment that could greatly reduce the cost of breast cancer treatment, both 
  in terms of toxic side effects and health care expenditures.},

  this study were: (1) to estimate relative magnitudes of different sources of 
  variation and (2) to evaluate agreement between biological and technical 
  replicates. RESULTS: We performed a microarray experiment using a total of 24 
  Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. The study included 4th mammary gland samples from 
  eight 21-day-old Sprague Dawley CD female rats exposed to genistein (soy

  at labeling and hybridization steps. A general linear model was used to 
  estimate variance components. Pearson correlations were computed to evaluate 
  agreement between technical and biological replicates. CONCLUSION: The 
  greatest source of variation was biological variation, followed by residual 
  error, and finally variation due to labeling when *.cel files were processed 
  with dChip and RMA image processing algorithms. When MAS 5.0 or GCRMA-EB were 
  used, the greatest source of variation was residual error, followed by 
  biology and labeling. Correlations between technical replicates were

  ABSTRACT = {Meta-analysis is now accepted as a necessary tool for the 
  evaluation of health care. Such analyses have been carried out in virtually 
  every area of medicine to evaluate a wide spectrum of health care 
  interventions and policies. This paper has three broad aims: (1) to describe 
  the basic principles of meta-analysis, using a meta-analysis of interventions 
  intended to reduce hospital re-admission rates for illustration; (2) to 
  consider threats to the internal validity of meta-analysis, and the measures 
  which can be taken to minimize their impact; and (3) to present an overview 
  of more specialist and developing methods for synthesizing data, with the 
  intention of outlining the directions meta-analysis may take in the future. 
  The methods used to synthesize studies, which take 'weighted averages' of 
  effect sizes have been refined to a high degree, while the methods for 
  dealing with threats to the validity of meta-analyses such as publication 
  bias, and variations in quality of the primary studies, are at a less 
  advanced stage. However, many consider this standard 'weighted average' 
  approach to meta-analysis not to be 'state of the art' in at least some 
  situations, where the use of more sophisticated methods, generally to explain 
  variation in estimates from different studies and synthesize a broader base 
  of evidence, would be advantageous. Currently, approaches which attempt to do 
  this are mainly still in the experimental stage and, unfortunately, ideas 
  which sound natural and appealing are often difficult to implement in 
  practice. Clearly, it will be some time before they are used routinely, but

  ABSTRACT = {The transcriptional regulatory network of Escherichia coli K-12 
  is among the best studied gene networks of any living cell. Transcription 
  factors bind to DNA either with their effector bound (holo conformation), or 
  as a free protein (apo conformation) regulating transcription initiation. By 
  using RegulonDB, the functional conformations (holo or apo) of transcription 
  factors, and their mode of regulation (activator, repressor, or dual) were 
  exhaustively analyzed. We report a striking discovery in the architecture of 
  the regulatory network, finding a strong under-representation of the apo 
  conformation (without allosteric metabolite) of transcription factors when 
  binding to their DNA sites to activate transcription. This observation is 
  supported at the level of individual regulatory interactions on promoters, 
  even if we exclude the promoters regulated by global transcription factors, 
  where three-quarters of the known promoters are regulated by a transcription 
  factor in holo conformation. This genome-scale analysis enables us to ask 
  what are the implications of these observations for the physiology and for 
  our understanding of the ecology of E. coli. We discuss these ideas within 
  the framework of the demand theory of gene regulation.},

  emergence of large numbers of complete genome sequences. High-throughput 
  annotation and metabolic modeling of these genomes is now a reality. The

  The fruition of this next frontier will depend on the integration of numerous 
  data sources relating to mechanisms, components and behavior of the 
  transcriptional regulatory machinery, as well as the integration of the 
  regulatory machinery into genome-scale cellular models. Here, we review 
  existing repositories for different types of transcriptional regulatory data, 
  including expression data, transcription factor data and binding site 
  locations and we explore how these data are being used for the reconstruction 
  of new regulatory networks. From template network-based methods to de novo 
  reverse engineering from expression data, we discuss how regulatory networks 
  can be reconstructed and integrated with metabolic models to improve model 
  predictions and performance. We also explore the impact these integrated 
  models can have in simulating phenotypes, optimizing the production of 
  compounds of interest or paving the way to a whole-cell model.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: DNA microarray data analysis has been used previously 
  to identify marker genes which discriminate cancer from normal samples. 
  However, due to the limited sample size of each study, there are few common 
  markers among different studies of the same cancer. With the rapid 
  accumulation of microarray data, it is of great interest to integrate 
  inter-study microarray data to increase sample size, which could lead to the 
  discovery of more reliable markers. RESULTS: We present a novel, simple 
  method of integrating different microarray datasets to identify marker genes 
  and apply the method to prostate cancer datasets. In this study, by applying 
  a new statistical method, referred to as the top-scoring pair (TSP) 
  classifier, we have identified a pair of robust marker genes (HPN and STAT6) 
  by integrating microarray datasets from three different prostate cancer 
  studies. Cross-platform validation shows that the TSP classifier built from 
  the marker gene pair, which simply compares relative expression values, 
  achieves high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity on independent datasets 
  generated using various array platforms. Our findings suggest a new model for 
  the discovery of marker genes from accumulated microarray data and 
  demonstrate how the great wealth of microarray data can be exploited to 
  increase the power of statistical analysis. CONTACT: leixu@jhu.edu.},

  ABSTRACT = {Batch effects are the systematic non-biological differences

  Previous work focused mainly on the development of methods for effective 
  batch effects removal. However, their impact on cross-batch prediction 
  performance, which is one of the most important goals in microarray-based 
  applications, has not been addressed. This paper uses a broad selection of 
  data sets from the Microarray Quality Control Phase II (MAQC-II) effort, 
  generated on three microarray platforms with different causes of batch 
  effects to assess the efficacy of their removal. Two data sets from 
  cross-tissue and cross-platform experiments are also included. Of the 120 
  cases studied using Support vector machines (SVM) and K nearest neighbors 
  (KNN) as classifiers and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) as 
  performance metric, we find that Ratio-G, Ratio-A, EJLR, mean-centering and 
  standardization methods perform better or equivalent to no batch effect

@ARTICLE{Carter2005,
  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Comparison of data produced on different microarray 
  platforms often shows surprising discordance. It is not clear whether this 
  discrepancy is caused by noisy data or by improper probe matching between 
  platforms. We investigated whether the significant level of inconsistency 
  between results produced by alternative gene expression microarray platforms 
  could be reduced by stringent sequence matching of microarray probes. We 
  mapped the short oligo probes of the Affymetrix platform onto cDNA clones of 
  the Stanford microarray platform. Affymetrix probes were reassigned to 
  redefined probe sets if they mapped to the same cDNA clone sequence, 
  regardless of the original manufacturer-defined grouping. The NCI-60 gene 
  expression profiles produced by Affymetrix HuFL platform were recalculated 
  using these redefined probe sets and compared to previously published cDNA 
  measurements of the same panel of RNA samples. RESULTS: The redefined probe 
  sets displayed a substantially higher level of cross-platform consistency at 
  the level of gene correlation, cell line correlation and unsupervised 
  hierarchical clustering. The same strategy allowed an almost complete 
  correspondence of breast cancer subtype classification between Affymetrix 
  gene chip and cDNA microarray derived gene expression data, and gave an 
  increased level of similarity between normal lung derived gene expression 
  profiles using the two technologies. In total, two Affymetrix gene-chip 
  platforms were remapped to three cDNA platforms in the various cross-platform 
  analyses, resulting in improved concordance in each case. CONCLUSION: We have 
  shown that probes which target overlapping transcript sequence regions on 
  cDNA microarrays and Affymetrix gene-chips exhibit a greater level of 
  concordance than the corresponding Unigene or sequence matched features. This 
  method will be useful for the integrated analysis of gene expression data 
  generated by multiple disparate measurement platforms.},

  ABSTRACT = {The circular chromosome of Escherichia coli has been suggested to 
  fold into a collection of sequentially consecutive domains, genes in each of 
  which tend to be co-expressed. It has also been suggested that such domains, 
  forming a partition of the genome, are dynamic with respect to the 
  physiological conditions. However, little is known about which DNA segments 
  of the E. coli genome form these domains and what determines the boundaries 
  of these domain segments. We present a computational model here to partition 
  the circular genome into consecutive segments, theoretically suggestive of 
  the physically folded supercoiled domains, along with a method for predicting 
  such domains under specified conditions. Our model is based on a hypothesis 
  that the genome of E. coli is partitioned into a set of folding domains so 
  that the total number of unfoldings of these domains in the folded chromosome 
  is minimized, where a domain is unfolded when a biological pathway, 
  consisting of genes encoded in this DNA segment, is being activated 
  transcriptionally. Based on this hypothesis, we have predicted seven distinct 
  sets of such domains along the E. coli genome for seven physiological 
  conditions, namely exponential growth, stationary growth, anaerobiosis, heat 
  shock, oxidative stress, nitrogen limitation and SOS responses. These 
  predicted folding domains are highly stable statistically and are generally 
  consistent with the experimental data of DNA binding sites of the 
  nucleoid-associated proteins that assist the folding of these domains, as 
  well as genome-scale protein occupancy profiles, hence supporting our 
  proposed model. Our study established for the first time a strong link 
  between a folded E. coli chromosomal structure and the encoded biological 
  pathways and their activation frequencies.},

  those with single or double base-pair hybridization mismatches, demonstrating

  intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in 
  data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) 
  average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and 
  Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data 
  analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a 
  robust multi-array average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and 
  log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures 
  using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, 
  variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the 
  algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential 
  expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious 
  downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity 
  using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

  amplification. The primers were used to amplify yeast ORFs in 96-well plates, 
  and the resulting products were arrayed using an automated micro arraying 
  device. Arrays containing up to 2,479 yeast ORFs were printed on a single

  detected and quantitated with a laser confocal scanning microscope. 
  Applications of the microarrays are shown for genetic and gene expression

  we constructed a protein array of about 6,000 yeast transformants, with each 
  transformant expressing one of the open reading frames as a fusion to an 
  activation domain. This array was screened by a simple and automated 
  procedure for 192 yeast proteins, with positive responses identified by their 
  positions in the array. In a second approach, we pooled cells expressing one 
  of about 6,000 activation domain fusions to generate a library. We used a 
  high-throughput screening procedure to screen nearly all of the 6,000 
  predicted yeast proteins, expressed as Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion 
  proteins, against the library, and characterized positives by sequence 
  analysis. These approaches resulted in the detection of 957 putative 
  interactions involving 1,004 S. cerevisiae proteins. These data reveal

  local structural properties of the DNA molecule wherein the DNA sequence only 
  plays an indirect supportive role. These properties are nevertheless an 
  important factor in a large number of biomolecular processes and can be 
  considered as informative signals for the presence of a variety of genomic 
  features. Several recent studies have unequivocally shown the benefit of 
  relying on such DNA properties for modeling and predicting genomic features 
  as diverse as transcription start sites, transcription factor binding sites, 
  or nucleosome occupancy. This review is meant to provide an overview of the

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: Query-based biclustering techniques allow 
  interrogating a gene expression compendium with a given gene or gene list. 
  They do so by searching for genes in the compendium that have a profile close 
  to the average expression profile of the genes in this query-list. As it can 
  often not be guaranteed that the genes in a long query-list will all be 
  mutually coexpressed, it is advisable to use each gene separately as a query. 
  This approach, however, leaves the user with a tedious post-processing of 
  partially redundant biclustering results. The fact that for each query-gene 
  multiple parameter settings need to be tested in order to detect the 'most 
  optimal bicluster size' adds to the redundancy problem. RESULTS: To aid with 
  this post-processing, we developed an ensemble approach to be used in 
  combination with query-based biclustering. The method relies on a 
  specifically designed consensus matrix in which the biclustering outcomes for 
  multiple query-genes and for different possible parameter settings are merged 
  in a statistically robust way. Clustering of this matrix results in distinct, 
  non-redundant consensus biclusters that maximally reflect the information 
  contained within the original query-based biclustering results. The 
  usefulness of the developed approach is illustrated on a biological case 
  study in Escherichia coli. Availability and implementation: Compiled Matlab

  other hand, is a facultative intracellular pathogen. These two prokaryotic 
  species can be considered related phylogenetically, and they share a large 
  amount of their genetic material, which is commonly termed the "core genome." 
  Despite their shared core genome, both species display very different 
  lifestyles, and it is unclear to what extent the core genome, apart from the 
  species-specific genes, plays a role in this lifestyle divergence. In this 
  study, we focus on the differences in expression domains for the orthologous 
  genes in E. coli and S. Typhimurium. The iterative comparison of coexpression 
  methodology was used on large expression compendia of both species to uncover 
  the conservation and divergence of gene expression. We found that gene 
  expression conservation occurs mostly independently from amino acid 
  similarity. According to our estimates, at least more than one quarter of the 
  orthologous genes has a different expression domain in E. coli than in S. 
  Typhimurium. Genes involved with key cellular processes are most likely to 
  have conserved their expression domains, whereas genes showing diverged 
  expression are associated with metabolic processes that, although present in 
  both species, are regulated differently. The expression domains of the shared 
  "core" genome of E. coli and S. Typhimurium, consisting of highly conserved 
  orthologs, have been tuned to help accommodate the differences in lifestyle 
  and the pathogenic potential of Salmonella.},

  ABSTRACT = {The transcriptional regulatory network of Escherichia coli K-12

  using RegulonDB, the functional conformations (holo or apo) of transcription 
  factors, and their mode of regulation (activator, repressor, or dual) were 
  exhaustively analyzed. We report a striking discovery in the architecture of 
  the regulatory network, finding a strong under-representation of the apo 
  conformation (without allosteric metabolite) of transcription factors when 
  binding to their DNA sites to activate transcription. This observation is 
  supported at the level of individual regulatory interactions on promoters, 
  even if we exclude the promoters regulated by global transcription factors, 
  where three-quarters of the known promoters are regulated by a transcription 
  factor in holo conformation. This genome-scale analysis enables us to ask

  ABSTRACT = {ABSTRACT Six subspecies are currently recognized in Salmonella 
  enterica. Subspecies I (subspecies enterica) is responsible for nearly all 
  infections in humans and warm-blooded animals, while five other subspecies 
  are isolated principally from cold-blooded animals. We sequenced 21 
  phylogenetically diverse strains, including two representatives from each of 
  the previously unsequenced five subspecies and 11 diverse new strains from S. 
  enterica subspecies enterica, to put this species into an evolutionary 
  perspective. The phylogeny of the subspecies was partly obscured by abundant 
  recombination events between lineages and a relatively short period of time 
  within which subspeciation took place. Nevertheless, a variety of different 
  tree-building methods gave congruent evolutionary tree topologies for 
  subspeciation. A total of 285 gene families were identified that were 
  recruited into subspecies enterica, and most of these are of unknown 
  function. At least 2,807 gene families were identified in one or more of the 
  other subspecies that are not found in subspecies I or Salmonella bongori. 
  Among these gene families were 13 new candidate effectors and 7 new candidate 
  fimbrial clusters. A third complete type III secretion system not present in 
  subspecies enterica (I) isolates was found in both strains of subspecies 
  salamae (II). Some gene families had complex taxonomies, such as the type VI 
  secretion systems, which were recruited from four different lineages in five 
  of six subspecies. Analysis of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rates 
  indicated that the more-recently acquired regions in S. enterica are 
  undergoing faster fixation rates than the rest of the genome. Recently 
  acquired AT-rich regions, which often encode virulence functions, are under 
  ongoing selection to maintain their high AT content. IMPORTANCE We have 
  sequenced 21 new genomes which encompass the phylogenetic diversity of 
  Salmonella, including strains of the previously unsequenced subspecies 
  arizonae, diarizonae, houtenae, salamae, and indica as well as new diverse 
  strains of subspecies enterica. We have deduced possible evolutionary paths 
  traversed by this very important zoonotic pathogen and identified novel 
  putative virulence factors that are not found in subspecies I. Gene families 
  gained at the time of the evolution of subspecies enterica are of particular 
  interest because they include mechanisms by which this subspecies adapted to

  data sources relating to mechanisms, components and behavior of the 
  transcriptional regulatory machinery, as well as the integration of the 
  regulatory machinery into genome-scale cellular models. Here, we review 
  existing repositories for different types of transcriptional regulatory data, 
  including expression data, transcription factor data and binding site 
  locations and we explore how these data are being used for the reconstruction 
  of new regulatory networks. From template network-based methods to de novo 
  reverse engineering from expression data, we discuss how regulatory networks 
  can be reconstructed and integrated with metabolic models to improve model 
  predictions and performance. We also explore the impact these integrated 
  models can have in simulating phenotypes, optimizing the production of 
  compounds of interest or paving the way to a whole-cell model.},

  ABSTRACT = {The structural properties of the DNA molecule are known to play a 
  critical role in transcription. In this paper, the structural profiles of 
  promoter regions were studied within the context of their diversity and their 
  function for eleven prokaryotic species; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella 
  pneumoniae, Salmonella Typhimurium, Pseudomonas auroginosa, Geobacter 
  sulfurreducens Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Synechocystis 
  sp., Synechoccocus elongates, Bacillus anthracis, and the archaea Sulfolobus 
  solfataricus. The main anchor point for these promoter regions were 
  transcription start sites identified through high-throughput experiments or 
  collected within large curated databases. Prokaryotic promoter regions were 
  found to be less stable and less flexible than the genomic mean across all 
  studied species. However, direct comparison between species revealed 
  differences in their structural profiles that can not solely be explained by 
  the difference in genomic GC content. In addition, comparison with functional 
  data revealed that there are patterns in the promoter structural profiles 
  that can be linked to specific functional loci, such as sigma factor 
  regulation or transcription factor binding. Interestingly, a novel structural 
  element clearly visible near the transcription start site was found in genes 
  associated with essential cellular functions and growth in several species. 
  Our analyses reveals the great diversity in promoter structural profiles both 
  between and within prokaryotic species. We observed relationships between 
  structural diversity and functional features that are interesting prospects 
  for further research to yet uncharacterized functional loci defined by DNA 
  structural properties.},

  ABSTRACT = {Batch effects are the systematic non-biological differences 
  between batches (groups) of samples in microarray experiments due to various 
  causes such as differences in sample preparation and hybridization protocols. 
  Previous work focused mainly on the development of methods for effective 
  batch effects removal. However, their impact on cross-batch prediction 
  performance, which is one of the most important goals in microarray-based 
  applications, has not been addressed. This paper uses a broad selection of 
  data sets from the Microarray Quality Control Phase II (MAQC-II) effort, 
  generated on three microarray platforms with different causes of batch 
  effects to assess the efficacy of their removal. Two data sets from 
  cross-tissue and cross-platform experiments are also included. Of the 120 
  cases studied using Support vector machines (SVM) and K nearest neighbors 
  (KNN) as classifiers and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) as 
  performance metric, we find that Ratio-G, Ratio-A, EJLR, mean-centering and 
  standardization methods perform better or equivalent to no batch effect 
  removal in 89, 85, 83, 79 and 75\% of the cases, respectively, suggesting 
  that the application of these methods is generally advisable and ratio-based

@ARTICLE{Welsh2013,
  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Many gene expression normalization algorithms exist 
  for Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. The most popular of these is RMA, 
  primarily due to the precision and low noise produced during the process. A 
  significant strength of this and similar approaches is the use of the entire 
  set of arrays during both normalization and model-based estimation of signal. 
  However, this leads to differing estimates of expression based on the 
  starting set of arrays, and estimates can change when a single, additional 
  chip is added to the set. Additionally, outlier chips can impact the signals 
  of other arrays, and can themselves be skewed by the majority of the 
  population. RESULTS: We developed an approach, termed IRON, which uses the 
  best-performing techniques from each of several popular processing methods 
  while retaining the ability to incrementally renormalize data without 
  altering previously normalized expression. This combination of approaches 
  results in a method that performs comparably to existing approaches on 
  artificial benchmark datasets (i.e. spike-in) and demonstrates promising 
  improvements in segregating true signals within biologically complex 
  experiments. CONCLUSIONS: By combining approaches from existing normalization 
  techniques, the IRON method offers several advantages. First, IRON 
  normalization occurs pair-wise, thereby avoiding the need for all chips to be 
  normalized together, which can be important for large data analyses. 
  Secondly, the technique does not require similarity in signal distribution 
  across chips for normalization, which can be important for maintaining 
  biologically relevant differences in a heterogeneous background. Lastly, IRON 
  introduces fewer post-processing artifacts, particularly in data whose 
  behavior violates common assumptions. Thus, the IRON method provides a 
  practical solution to common needs of expression analysis. A software 
  implementation of IRON is available at [http://gene.moffitt.org/libaffy/].},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: As more methods are developed to analyze 
  RNA-profiling data, assessing their performance using control datasets 
  becomes increasingly important. RESULTS: We present a 'spike-in' experiment 
  for Affymetrix GeneChips that provides a defined dataset of 3,860 RNA 
  species, which we use to evaluate analysis options for identifying 
  differentially expressed genes. The experimental design incorporates two 
  novel features. First, to obtain accurate estimates of false-positive and 
  false-negative rates, 100-200 RNAs are spiked in at each fold-change level of 
  interest, ranging from 1.2 to 4-fold. Second, instead of using an 
  uncharacterized background RNA sample, a set of 2,551 RNA species is used as 
  the constant (1x) set, allowing us to know whether any given probe set is 
  truly present or absent. Application of a large number of analysis methods to 
  this dataset reveals clear variation in their ability to identify 
  differentially expressed genes. False-negative and false-positive rates are 
  minimized when the following options are chosen: subtracting nonspecific 
  signal from the PM probe intensities; performing an intensity-dependent 
  normalization at the probe set level; and incorporating a signal 
  intensity-dependent standard deviation in the test statistic. CONCLUSIONS: A 
  best-route combination of analysis methods is presented that allows detection 
  of approximately 70\% of true positives before reaching a 10\% 
  false-discovery rate. We highlight areas in need of improvement, including 
  better estimate of false-discovery rates and decreased false-negative rates.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: In the Affymetrix GeneChip system, preprocessing 
  occurs before one obtains expression level measurements. Because the number 
  of competing preprocessing methods was large and growing we developed a 
  benchmark to help users identify the best method for their application. A 
  webtool was made available for developers to benchmark their procedures. At 
  the time of writing over 50 methods had been submitted. RESULTS: We 
  benchmarked 31 probe set algorithms using a U95A dataset of spike in 
  controls. Using this dataset, we found that background correction, one of the 
  main steps in preprocessing, has the largest effect on performance. In 
  particular, background correction appears to improve accuracy but, in 
  general, worsen precision. The benchmark results put this balance in 
  perspective. Furthermore, we have improved some of the original benchmark 
  metrics to provide more detailed information regarding precision and 
  accuracy. A handful of methods stand out as providing the best balance using 
  spike-in data with the older U95A array, although different experiments on 
  more current arrays may benchmark differently. AVAILABILITY: The affycomp

  the standardization of chip manufacturing and hybridization process. As a

  ABSTRACT    = {Background: Reproducibility is a fundamental requirement in 
  scientific experiments. Some recent publications have claimed that 
  microarrays are unreliable because lists of differentially expressed genes 
  (DEGs) are not reproducible in similar experiments. Meanwhile, new 
  statistical methods for identifying DEGs continue to appear in the scientific 
  literature. The resultant variety of existing and emerging methods 
  exacerbates confusion and continuing debate in the microarray community on 
  the appropriate choice of methods for identifying reliable DEG lists. 
  Results: Using the data sets generated by the MicroArray Quality Control 
  (MAQC) project, we investigated the impact on the reproducibility of DEG 
  lists of a few widely used gene selection procedures. We present 
  comprehensive results from inter-site comparisons using the same microarray 
  platform, cross-platform comparisons using multiple microarray platforms, and 
  comparisons between microarray results and those from TaqMan the widely 
  regarded "standard" gene expression platform. Our results demonstrate that 
  (1) previously reported discordance between DEG lists could simply result 
  from ranking and selecting DEGs solely by statistical significance (P) 
  derived from widely used simple t-tests; (2) when fold change (FC) is used as 
  the ranking criterion with a non-stringent P-value cutoff filtering, the DEG 
  lists become much more reproducible, especially when fewer genes are selected 
  as differentially expressed, as is the case in most microarray studies; and 
  (3) the instability of short DEG lists solely based on P-value ranking is an 
  expected mathematical consequence of the high variability of the t-values; 
  the more stringent the P-value threshold, the less reproducible the DEG list 
  is. These observations are also consistent with results from extensive 
  simulation calculations. Conclusion: We recommend the use of FC-ranking plus 
  a non-stringent P cutoff as a straightforward and baseline practice in order 
  to generate more reproducible DEG lists. Specifically, the P-value cutoff 
  should not be stringent (too small) and FC should be as large as possible. 
  Our results provide practical guidance to choose the appropriate FC and 
  P-value cutoffs when selecting a given number of DEGs. The FC criterion 
  enhances reproducibility, whereas the P criterion balances sensitivity and 
  specificity.},

  ABSTRACT = {A major challenge in drug discovery is to distinguish the 
  molecular targets of a bioactive compound from the hundreds to thousands of 
  additional gene products that respond indirectly to changes in the activity 
  of the targets. Here, we present an integrated computational-experimental 
  approach for computing the likelihood that gene products and associated 
  pathways are targets of a compound. This is achieved by filtering the mRNA 
  expression profile of compound-exposed cells using a reverse-engineered model 
  of the cell's gene regulatory network. We apply the method to a set of 515 
  whole-genome yeast expression profiles resulting from a variety of treatments 
  (compounds, knockouts and induced expression), and correctly enrich for the 
  known targets and associated pathways in the majority of compounds examined. 
  We demonstrate our approach with PTSB, a growth inhibitory compound with a 
  previously unknown mode of action, by predicting and validating thioredoxin 
  and thioredoxin reductase as its target.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: A key problem of drug development is to decide which 
  compounds to evaluate further in expensive clinical trials (Phase I- III). 
  This decision is primarily based on the primary targets and mechanisms of 
  action of the chemical compounds under consideration. Whole-genome expression 
  measurements have shown to be useful for this process but current approaches 
  suffer from requiring either a large number of mutant experiments or a 
  detailed understanding of the regulatory networks. RESULTS: We have designed 
  an algorithm, CutTree that when applied to whole-genome expression datasets 
  identifies the primary affected genes (PAGs) of a chemical compound by 
  separating them from downstream, indirectly affected genes. Unlike previous 
  methods requiring whole-genome deletion libraries or a complete map of gene 
  network architecture, CutTree identifies PAGs from a limited set of 
  experimental perturbations without requiring any prior information about the 
  underlying pathways. The principle for CutTree is to iteratively filter out 
  PAGs from other recurrently active genes (RAGs) that are not PAGs. The in 
  silico validation predicted that CutTree should be able to identify 3-4 out 
  of 5 known PAGs (approximately 70\%). In accordance, when we applied CutTree 
  to whole-genome expression profiles from 17 genetic perturbations in the 
  presence of galactose in Yeast, CutTree identified four out of five known 
  primary galactose targets (80\%). Using an exhaustive search strategy to 
  detect these PAGs would not have been feasible (>1012 combinations). 
  CONCLUSION: In combination with genetic perturbation techniques like short 
  interfering RNA (siRNA) followed by whole-genome expression measurements, 
  CutTree sets the stage for compound target identification in less 
  well-characterized but more disease-relevant mammalian cell systems.},

  ABSTRACT = {The development and progression of cancer and the experimental 
  reversal of tumorigenicity are accompanied by complex changes in patterns of 
  gene expression. Microarrays of cDNA provide a powerful tool for studying 
  these complex phenomena. The tumorigenic properties of a human melanoma cell 
  line, UACC-903, can be suppressed by introduction of a normal human 
  chromosome 6, resulting in a reduction of growth rate, restoration of contact 
  inhibition, and suppression of both soft agar clonogenicity and 
  tumorigenicity in nude mice. We used a high density microarray of 1,161 DNA 
  elements to search for differences in gene expression associated with tumour 
  suppression in this system. Fluorescent probes for hybridization were derived 
  from two sources of cellular mRNA [UACC-903 and UACC-903(+6)] which were 
  labelled with different fluors to provide a direct and internally controlled 
  comparison of the mRNA levels corresponding to each arrayed gene. The 
  fluorescence signals representing hybridization to each arrayed gene were 
  analysed to determine the relative abundance in the two samples of mRNAs 
  corresponding to each gene. Previously unrecognized alterations in the 
  expression of specific genes provide leads for further investigation of the 
  genetic basis of the tumorigenic phenotype of these cells.},

  ABSTRACT    = {The BLAST programs are widely used tools for searching protein and DNA databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

  ABSTRACT   = {To facilitate collaborative research efforts between multi-investigator teams using DNA microarrays, we identified sources of error and data variability between laboratories and across microarray platforms, and methods to accommodate this variability. RNA expression data were generated in seven laboratories, which compared two standard RNA samples using 12 microarray platforms. At least two standard microarray types (one spotted, one commercial) were used by all laboratories. Reproducibility for most platforms within any laboratory was typically good, but reproducibility between platforms and across laboratories was generally poor. Reproducibility between laboratories increased markedly when standardized protocols were implemented for RNA labeling, hybridization, microarray processing, data acquisition and data normalization. Reproducibility was highest when analysis was based on biological themes defined by enriched Gene Ontology (GO) categories. These findings indicate that microarray results can be comparable across multiple laboratories, especially when a common platform and set of procedures are used.},

  ABSTRACT    = {A decade ago, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was established at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The original objective of GEO was to serve as a public repository for high-throughput gene expression data generated mostly by microarray technology. However, the research community quickly applied microarrays to non-gene-expression studies, including examination of genome copy number variation and genome-wide profiling of DNA-binding proteins. Because the GEO database was designed with a flexible structure, it was possible to quickly adapt the repository to store these data types. More recently, as the microarray community switches to next-generation sequencing technologies, GEO has again adapted to host these data sets. Today, GEO stores over 20000 microarray- and sequence-based functional genomics studies, and continues to handle the majority of direct high-throughput data submissions from the research community. Multiple mechanisms are provided to help users effectively search, browse, download and visualize the data at the level of individual genes or entire studies. This paper describes recent database enhancements, including new search and data representation tools, as well as a brief review of how the community uses GEO data. GEO is freely accessible at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/.},

  ABSTRACT    = {The Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) aims to provide high-quality electronic and manual annotations to the UniProt Knowledgebase (Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL and PIR-PSD) using the standardized vocabulary of the Gene Ontology (GO). As a supplementary archive of GO annotation, GOA promotes a high level of integration of the knowledge represented in UniProt with other databases. This is achieved by converting UniProt annotation into a recognized computational format. GOA provides annotated entries for nearly 60 000 species (GOA-SPTr) and is the largest and most comprehensive open-source contributor of annotations to the GO Consortium annotation effort. By integrating GO annotations from other model organism groups, GOA consolidates specialized knowledge and expertise to ensure the data remain a key reference for up-to-date biological information. Furthermore, the GOA database fully endorses the Human Proteomics Initiative by prioritizing the annotation of proteins likely to benefit human health and disease. In addition to a non-redundant set of annotations to the human proteome (GOA-Human) and monthly releases of its GO annotation for all species (GOA-SPTr), a series of GO mapping files and specific cross-references in other databases are also regularly distributed. GOA can be queried through a simple user-friendly web interface or downloaded in a parsable format via the EBI and GO FTP websites. The GOA data set can be used to enhance the annotation of particular model organism or gene expression data sets, although increasingly it has been used to evaluate GO predictions generated from text mining or protein interaction experiments. In 2004, the GOA team will build on its success and will continue to supplement the functional annotation of UniProt and work towards enhancing the ability of scientists to access all available biological information. Researchers wishing to query or contribute to the GOA project are encouraged to email: goaebi.ac.uk.},

  ABSTRACT    = {Fur is a DNA binding protein that represses bacterial iron uptake systems. Eleven footprinted Escherichia coli Fur binding sites were used to create an initial information theory model of Fur binding, which was then refined by adding 13 experimentally confirmed sites. When the refined model was scanned across all available footprinted sequences, sequence walkers, which are visual depictions of predicted binding sites, frequently appeared in clusters that fit the footprints (83\% coverage). This indicated that the model can accurately predict Fur binding. Within the clusters, individual walkers were separated from their neighbors by exactly 3 or 6 bases, consistent with models in which Fur dimers bind on different faces of the DNA helix. When the E. coli genome was scanned, we found 363 unique clusters, which includes all known Fur-repressed genes that are involved in iron metabolism. In contrast, only a few of the known Fur-activated genes have predicted Fur binding sites at their promoters. These observations suggest that Fur is either a direct repressor or an indirect activator. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis Fur models are highly similar to the E. coli Fur model, suggesting that the FurDNA recognition mechanism may be conserved for even distantly related bacteria.},

The Model Genome Interrogator (MGI) tool supports mapping gene lists onto corresponding genes from model plant organisms, including rice and Arabidopsis. MGI predicts homologies, displays gene structures and supporting information for annotated genes and full-length cDNAs. The gene list-processing wizard guides users through PLEXdb functions for creating, analyzing, annotating and managing gene lists. Users can upload their own lists or create them from the output of PLEXdb tools, and then apply diverse higher level analyses, such as ANOVA and clustering. PLEXdb also provides methods for users to track how gene expression changes across many different experiments using the Gene OscilloScope.

First of all, CORNET allows the integration of regulatory interaction datasets accessible through the new transcription factor (TF) tool that can be used in combination with the coexpression tool or the PPI tool. In addition, we have extended the PPI tool to enable the analysis of gene-gene associations from AraNet as well as newly identified PPIs. Different search options are implemented to enable the construction of networks centered around multiple input genes or proteins. New functional annotation resources are included to retrieve relevant literature, phenotypes, plant ontology and biological pathways. We have also extended CORNET to attain the construction of coexpression and PPI networks in the crop species maize. Networks and associated evidence of the majority of currently available data types are visualized in Cytoscape. CORNET is available at https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/cornet.},

  ABSTRACT = {Transcriptome microarrays have become one of the tools of choice for investigating the genes involved in tumorigenesis and tumor progression, as well as finding new biomarkers and gene expression signatures for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Here, we describe a new database for Integrated Tumor Transcriptome Array and Clinical data Analysis (ITTACA). ITTACA centralizes public datasets containing both gene expression and clinical data. ITTACA currently focuses on the types of cancer that are of particular interest to research teams at Institut Curie: breast carcinoma, bladder carcinoma and uveal melanoma. A web interface allows users to carry out different class comparison analyses, including the comparison of expression distribution profiles, tests for differential expression and patient survival analyses. ITTACA is complementary to other databases, such as GEO and SMD, because it offers a better integration of clinical data and different functionalities. It also offers more options for class comparison analyses when compared with similar projects such as Oncomine. For example, users can define their own patient groups according to clinical data or gene expression levels. This added flexibility and the user-friendly web interface makes ITTACA especially useful for comparing personal results with the results in the existing literature. ITTACA is accessible online at http://bioinfo.curie.fr/ittaca.},

  ABSTRACT  = {Background Microarrays are the main technology for large-scale transcriptional gene expression profiling, but the large bodies of data available in public databases are not useful due to the large heterogeneity. There are several initiatives that attempt to bundle these data into expression compendia, but such resources for bacterial organisms are scarce and limited to integration of experiments from the same platform or to indirect integration of per experiment analysis results. Methodology/Principal Findings We have constructed comprehensive organism-specific cross-platform expression compendia for three bacterial model organisms (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium) together with an access portal, dubbed COLOMBOS, that not only provides easy access to the compendia, but also includes a suite of tools for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing the data within these compendia. It is freely available at http://bioi.biw.kuleuven.be/colombos. The compendia are unique in directly combining expression information from different microarray platforms and experiments, and we illustrate the potential benefits of this direct integration with a case study: extending the known regulon of the Fur transcription factor of E. coli. The compendia also incorporate extensive annotations for both genes and experimental conditions; these heterogeneous data are functionally integrated in the COLOMBOS analysis tools to interactively browse and query the compendia not only for specific genes or experiments, but also metabolic pathways, transcriptional regulation mechanisms, experimental conditions, biological processes, etc. Conclusions/Significance We have created cross-platform expression compendia for several bacterial organisms and developed a complementary access port COLOMBOS, that also serves as a convenient expression analysis tool to extract useful biological information. This work is relevant to a large community of microbiologists by facilitating the use of publicly available microarray experiments to support their research.},

  ABSTRACT    = {MOTIVATION: We describe an approach to normalize spotted microarray data, based on a physically motivated calibration model. This model consists of two major components, describing the hybridization of target transcripts to their corresponding probes on the one hand, and the measurement of fluorescence from the hybridized, labeled target on the other hand. The model parameters and error distributions are estimated from external control spikes. RESULTS: Using a publicly available dataset, we show that our procedure is capable of adequately removing the typical non-linearities of the data, without making any assumptions on the distribution of differences in gene expression from one biological sample to the next. Since our model links target concentration to measured intensity, we show how absolute expression values of target transcripts in the hybridization solution can be estimated up to a certain degree.},

  ABSTRACT = {The adaptation of bacteria to the vigorous environmental changes they undergo is crucial to their survival. They achieve this adaptation partly via intricate regulation of the transcription of their genes. In this study, we infer the transcriptional network of the Gram-positive model organism, Bacillus subtilis. We use a data integration workflow, exploiting both motif and expression data, towards the generation of condition-dependent transcriptional modules. In building the motif data, we rely on both known and predicted information. Known motifs were derived from DBTBS, while predicted motifs were generated by a de novo motif detection method that utilizes comparative genomics. The expression data consists of a compendium of microarrays across different platforms. Our results indicate that a considerable part of the B. subtilis network is yet undiscovered; we could predict 417 new regulatory interactions for known regulators and 453 interactions for yet uncharacterized regulators. The regulators in our network showed a preference for regulating modules in certain environmental conditions. Also, substantial condition-dependent intra-operonic regulation seems to take place. Global regulators seem to require functional flexibility to attain their roles by acting as both activators and repressors.},

@ARTICLE{Fierro2008,
  ABSTRACT = {Since the second half of the 1990s, a large number of genome-wide analyses have been described that study gene expression at the transcript level. To this end, two major strategies have been adopted, a first one relying on hybridization techniques such as microarrays, and a second one based on sequencing techniques such as serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), cDNA-AFLP, and analysis based on expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Despite both types of profiling experiments becoming routine techniques in many research groups, their application remains costly and laborious. As a result, the number of conditions profiled in individual studies is still relatively small and usually varies from only two to few hundreds of samples for the largest experiments. More and more, scientific journals require the deposit of these high throughput experiments in public databases upon publication. Mining the information present in these databases offers molecular biologists the possibility to view their own small-scale analysis in the light of what is already available. However, so far, the richness of the public information remains largely unexploited. Several obstacles such as the correct association between ESTs and microarray probes with the corresponding gene transcript, the incompleteness and inconsistency in the annotation of experimental conditions, and the lack of standardized experimental protocols to generate gene expression data, all impede the successful mining of these data. Here, we review the potential and difficulties of combining publicly available expression data from respectively EST analyses and microarray experiments. With examples from literature, we show how meta-analysis of expression profiling experiments can be used to study expression behavior in a single organism or between organisms, across a wide range of experimental conditions. We also provide an overview of the methods and tools that can aid molecular biologists in exploiting these public data.},

This paper summarizes the improvements, new biology and new features available in version 6.0. Curation of original literature is, from now on, up to date for every new release. All the objects are supported by their corresponding evidences, now classified as strong or weak. Transcription factors are classified by origin of their effectors and by gene ontology class. We have now computational predictions for sigma(54) and five different promoter types of the sigma(70) family, as well as their corresponding -10 and -35 boxes. In addition to those curated from the literature, we added about 300 experimentally mapped promoters coming from our own high-throughput mapping efforts. RegulonDB v.6.0 now expands beyond transcription initiation, including RNA regulatory elements, specifically riboswitches, attenuators and small RNAs, with their known associated targets. The data can be accessed through overviews of correlations about gene regulation. RegulonDB associated original literature, together with more than 4000 curation notes, can now be searched with the Textpresso text mining engine.},

  ABSTRACT    = {Escherichia coli possesses multiple routes for iron uptake. Here we present EfeU (YcdN), a novel iron acquisition system of E. coli strain Nissle 1917. Laboratory strains of E. coli such as K12 lack a functional (efeU) ycdN gene caused by a frameshift mutation. EfeU, a member of the oxidase-dependent iron transporters (OFeT), is a homologue of the iron permease Ftr1p from yeast. The ycdN gene is part of the ycdNOB tricistronic operon which is expressed in response to iron deprivation in a Fur-dependent manner. Expression of efeU resulted in improved growth of an E. coli mutant lacking all known iron-uptake systems and mediated increased iron uptake into cells. Furthermore, the presence of other divalent metal cations did not impair growth of strains expressing efeU. The EfeU protein functioned as ferrous iron permease in proteoliposomes in vitro. Topology analysis indicated that EfeU is an integral cytoplasmic membrane protein exhibiting seven transmembrane helices. Two REXXE motifs within transmembrane helices of OFeT family members are implicated in iron translocation. Site-directed mutagenesis of each REGLE motif of EfeU diminished iron uptake in vivo and growth yield. In vitro the EfeU variant protein with an altered first REGLE motif was impaired in iron permeation, whereas activity of the EfeU variant with a mutation in the second motif was similar to the wild-type protein.},

  ABSTRACT = {Microarray technology is a powerful tool for measuring RNA expression for thousands of genes at once. Various studies have been published comparing competing platforms with mixed results: some find agreement, others do not. As the number of researchers starting to use microarrays and the number of cross-platform meta-analysis studies rapidly increases, appropriate platform assessments become more important. Here we present results from a comparison study that offers important improvements over those previously described in the literature. In particular, we noticed that none of the previously published papers consider differences between labs. For this study, a consortium of ten laboratories from the Washington, DC-Baltimore, USA, area was formed to compare data obtained from three widely used platforms using identical RNA samples. We used appropriate statistical analysis to demonstrate that there are relatively large differences in data obtained in labs using the same platform, but that the results from the best-performing labs agree rather well.},

The content of this database derives from curation, re-annotation and statistical analysis of selected data from the ArrayExpress Archive of Functional Genomics Data. A simple interface allows the user to query for differential gene expression either (i) by gene names or attributes such as Gene Ontology terms, or (ii) by biological conditions, e.g. diseases, organism parts or cell types. The gene queries return the conditions where expression has been reported, while condition queries return which genes are reported to be expressed in these conditions. A combination of both query types is possible. The query results are ranked using various statistical measures and by how many independent studies in the database show the particular gene-condition association. Currently, the database contains information about more than 200,000 genes from nine species and almost 4500 biological conditions studied in over 30,000 assays from over 1000 independent studies.},

The diversity of platforms and analytical methods available to researchers have made the comparison of data from multiple platforms challenging. In this study, we describe a framework for comparisons across platforms and laboratories. We have attempted to include nearly all the available commercial and 'in-house' platforms. Using probe sequences matched at the exon level improved consistency of measurements across the different microarray platforms compared to annotation-based matches. Generally, consistency was good for highly expressed genes, and variable for genes with lower expression values as confirmed by quantitative real-time (QRT)-PCR. Concordance of measurements was higher between laboratories on the same platform than across platforms. We demonstrate that, after stringent preprocessing, commercial arrays were more consistent than in-house arrays, and by most measures, one-dye platforms were more consistent than two-dye platforms.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in cDNA and oligonucleotide DNA arrays have made it possible to measure the abundance of mRNA transcripts for many genes simultaneously. The analysis of such experiments is nontrivial because of large data size and many levels of variation introduced at different stages of the experiments. The analysis is further complicated by the large differences that may exist among different probes used to interrogate the same gene. However, an attractive feature of high-density oligonucleotide arrays such as those produced by photolithography and inkjet technology is the standardization of chip manufacturing and hybridization process. As a result, probe-specific biases, although significant, are highly reproducible and predictable, and their adverse effect can be reduced by proper modeling and analysis methods. Here, we propose a statistical model for the probe-level data, and develop model-based estimates for gene expression indexes. We also present model-based methods for identifying and handling cross-hybridizing probes and contaminating array regions. Applications of these results will be presented elsewhere.},

  ABSTRACT    = {A small RNA, RyhB, was found as part of a genomewide search for novel small RNAs in Escherichia coli. The RyhB 90-nt RNA down-regulates a set of iron-storage and iron-using proteins when iron is limiting; it is itself negatively regulated by the ferric uptake repressor protein, Fur (Ferric uptake regulator). RyhB RNA levels are inversely correlated with mRNA levels for the sdhCDAB operon, encoding succinate dehydrogenase, as well as five other genes previously shown to be positively regulated by Fur by an unknown mechanism. These include two other genes encoding enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, acnA and fumA, two ferritin genes, ftnA and bfr, and a gene for superoxide dismutase, sodB. Fur positive regulation of all these genes is fully reversed in an ryhB mutant. Our results explain the previously observed inability of fur mutants to grow on succinate. RyhB requires the RNA-binding protein, Hfq, for activity. Sequences within RyhB are complementary to regions within each of the target genes, suggesting that RyhB acts as an antisense RNA. In sdhCDAB, the complementary region is at the end of the first gene of the sdhCDAB operon; full-length sdhCDAB message disappears and a truncated message, equivalent in size to the region upstream of the complementarity, is detected when RyhB is expressed. RyhB provides a mechanism for the cell to down-regulate iron-storage proteins and nonessential ironcontaining proteins when iron is limiting, thus modulating intracellular iron usage to supplement mechanisms for iron uptake directly regulated by Fur.},

@ARTICLE{McHugh2003,
  ABSTRACT = {Organisms generally respond to iron deficiency by increasing their capacity to take up iron and by consuming intracellular iron stores. Escherichia coli, in which iron metabolism is particularly well understood, contains at least 7 iron-acquisition systems encoded by 35 iron-repressed genes. This Fe-dependent repression is mediated by a transcriptional repressor, Fur (ferric uptake regulation), which also controls genes involved in other processes such as iron storage, the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle, pathogenicity, and redox-stress resistance. Our macroarray-based global analysis of iron- and Fur-dependent gene expression in E. coli has revealed several novel Fur-repressed genes likely to specify at least three additional iron-transport pathways. Interestingly, a large group of energy metabolism genes was found to be iron and Fur induced. Many of these genes encode iron-rich respiratory complexes. This iron- and Fur-dependent regulation appears to represent a novel iron-homeostatic mechanism whereby the synthesis of many iron-containing proteins is repressed under iron-restricted conditions. This mechanism thus accounts for the low iron contents of fur mutants and explains how E. coli can modulate its iron requirements. Analysis of 55Fe-labeled E. coli proteins revealed a marked decrease in iron-protein composition for the fur mutant, and visible and EPR spectroscopy showed major reductions in cytochrome b and d levels, and in iron-sulfur cluster contents for the chelator-treated wild-type and/or fur mutant, correlating well with the array and quantitative RT-PCR data. In combination, the results provide compelling evidence for the regulation of intracellular iron consumption by the Fe2+-Fur complex.},

  ABSTRACT    = {Recognition of genomic binding sites by transcription factors can occur through base-specific recognition, or by recognition of variations within the structure of the DNA macromolecule. In this article, we investigate what information can be retrieved from local DNA structural properties that is relevant to transcription factor binding and that cannot be captured by the nucleotide sequence alone. More specifically, we explore the benefit of employing the structural characteristics of DNA to create binding-site models that encompass indirect recognition for the Escherichia coli model organism. We developed a novel methodology Conditional Random fields of Smoothed Structural Data (CRoSSeD), based on structural scales and conditional random fields to model and predict regulator binding sites. The value of relying on local structural-DNA properties is demonstrated by improved classifier performance on a large number of biological datasets, and by the detection of novel binding sites which could be validated by independent data sources, and which could not be identified using sequence data alone. We further show that the CRoSSeD-binding-site models can be related to the actual molecular mechanisms of the transcription factor DNA binding, and thus cannot only be used for prediction of novel sites, but might also give valuable insights into unknown binding mechanisms of transcription factors.},

  ABSTRACT = {FtnA is the major iron-storage protein of Escherichia coli accounting for < or = 50\% of total cellular iron. The FtnA gene (ftnA) is induced by iron in an Fe(2+)-Fur-dependent fashion. This effect is reportedly mediated by RyhB, the Fe(2+)-Fur-repressed, small, regulatory RNA. However, results presented here show that ftnA iron induction is independent of RyhB and instead involves direct interaction of Fe(2+)-Fur with an 'extended' Fur binding site (containing five tandem Fur boxes) located upstream (-83) of the ftnA promoter. In addition, H-NS acts as a direct repressor of ftnA transcription by binding at multiple sites (I-VI) within, and upstream of, the ftnA promoter. Fur directly competes with H-NS binding at upstream sites (II-IV) and consequently displaces H-NS from the ftnA promoter (sites V-VI) which in turn leads to derepression of ftnA transcription. It is proposed that H-NS binding within the ftnA promoter is facilitated by H-NS occupation of the upstream sites through H-NS oligomerization-induced DNA looping. Consequently, Fur displacement of H-NS from the upstream sites prevents cooperative H-NS binding at the downstream sites within the promoter, thus allowing access to RNA polymerase. This direct activation of ftnA transcription by Fe(2+)-Fur through H-NS antisilencing represents a new mechanism for iron-induced gene expression.},

  ABSTRACT    = {The recent development of microarray technology provided unprecedented opportunities to understand the genetic basis of aging. So far, many microarray studies have addressed aging-related expression patterns in multiple organisms and under different conditions. The number of relevant studies continues to increase rapidly. However, efficient exploitation of these vast data is frustrated by the lack of an integrated data mining platform or other unifying bioinformatic resource to enable convenient cross-laboratory searches of array signals. To facilitate the integrative analysis of microarray data on aging, we developed a web database and analysis platform 'Gene Aging Nexus' (GAN) that is freely accessible to the research community to query/analyze/visualize cross-platform and cross-species microarray data on aging. By providing the possibility of integrative microarray analysis, GAN should be useful in building the systems-biology understanding of aging. GAN is accessible at http://gan.usc.edu.},

Here we apply the comparative genomics approach to analyze candidate Fur-binding sites in the genomes of Escherichia coli (K12 and O157:H7), Salmonella typhi, Yersinia pestis and Vibrio cholerae. We describe a number of new loci encoding siderophore biosynthesis and transport proteins. A new regulator of iron-acquisition systems was found in S.typhi. We predict FUR regulation for several virulence systems. We also predict FUR regulation for the chemotaxis system of V.cholerae that is probably involved in the process of pathogenesis.},

@ARTICLE{Patzer2001,
  ABSTRACT    = {The uptake of Mn2+, a cofactor for several enzymes in Escherichia coli, is mediated by MntH, a proton-dependent metal transporter, which also recognizes Fe2+ with lower affinity. MntH belongs to the NRAMP family of eukaryotic Fe2+ and Mn2+ transporters. In E. coli strains with chromosomal mntH-lacZ fusions, mntH was partially repressed by both Mn2+ and Fe2+. Inactivation of fur resulted in the loss of Fe2+-dependent repression of mntH transcription, demonstrating that Fe2+ repression depends on the global iron regulator Fur. However, these fur mutants still showed Mn2+-dependent repression of mntH. The Mn2+-responsive transcriptional regulator of mntH was identified as the gene product of o155 (renamed MntR). mntR mutants were impaired in Mn2+ but not Fe2+ repression of mntH transcription. Binding of purified MntR to the mntH operator was manganese dependent. The binding region was localized by DNase I footprinting analysis and covers a nearly perfect palindrome. The Fur binding site, localized within 22 nucleotides of the mntH operator by in vivo operator titration assays, resembles the Fur-box consensus sequence.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: Microarray data must be background corrected to remove the effects of non-specific binding or spatial heterogeneity across the array, but this practice typically causes other problems such as negative corrected intensities and high variability of low intensity log-ratios. Different estimators of background, and various model-based processing methods, are compared in this study in search of the best option for differential expression analyses of small microarray experiments. RESULTS: Using data where some independent truth in gene expression is known, eight different background correction alternatives are compared, in terms of precision and bias of the resulting gene expression measures, and in terms of their ability to detect differentially expressed genes as judged by two popular algorithms, SAM and limma eBayes. A new background processing method (normexp) is introduced which is based on a convolution model. The model-based correction methods are shown to be markedly superior to the usual practice of subtracting local background estimates. Methods which stabilize the variances of the log-ratios along the intensity range perform the best. The normexp+offset method is found to give the lowest false discovery rate overall, followed by morph and vsn. Like vsn, normexp is applicable to most types of two-colour microarray data. AVAILABILITY: The background correction methods compared in this article are available in the R package limma (Smyth, 2005) from http://www.bioconductor.org.

These were responsible for the capture and amplification of numerous gene fragments and affect the composition, sizes, and positions of centromeres. We also report on the correlation of methylation-poor regions with Mu transposon insertions and recombination, and copy number variants with insertions and/or deletions, as well as how uneven gene losses between duplicated regions were involved in returning an ancient allotetraploid to a genetically diploid state.

The publication of studies with dissimilar or altogether contradictory results, obtained using different microarray platforms to analyze identical RNA samples, has raised concerns about the reliability of this technology. The MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project was initiated to address these concerns, as well as other performance and data analysis issues. Expression data on four titration pools from two distinct reference RNA samples were generated at multiple test sites using a variety of microarray-based and alternative technology platforms. Here we describe the experimental design and probe mapping efforts behind the MAQC project. We show intraplatform consistency across test sites as well as a high level of interplatform concordance in terms of genes identified as differentially expressed. This study provides a resource that represents an important first step toward establishing a framework for the use of microarrays in clinical and regulatory settings.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: The acceptance of microarray technology in regulatory decision-making is being challenged by the existence of various platforms and data analysis methods. A recent report (E. Marshall, Science, 306, 630-631, 2004), by extensively citing the study of Tan et al. (Nucleic Acids Res., 31, 5676-5684, 2003), portrays a disturbingly negative picture of the cross-platform comparability, and, hence, the reliability of microarray technology. RESULTS: We reanalyzed Tan's dataset and found that the intra-platform consistency was low, indicating a problem in experimental procedures from which the dataset was generated. Furthermore, by using three gene selection methods (i.e., p-value ranking, fold-change ranking, and Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM)) on the same dataset we found that p-value ranking (the method emphasized by Tan et al.) results in much lower cross-platform concordance compared to fold-change ranking or SAM. Therefore, the low cross-platform concordance reported in Tan's study appears to be mainly due to a combination of low intra-platform consistency and a poor choice of data analysis procedures, instead of inherent technical differences among different platforms, as suggested by Tan et al. and Marshall. CONCLUSION: Our results illustrate the importance of establishing calibrated RNA samples and reference datasets to objectively assess the performance of different microarray platforms and the proficiency of individual laboratories as well as the merits of various data analysis procedures. Thus, we are progressively coordinating the MAQC project, a community-wide effort for microarray quality control.},

  ABSTRACT = {DBTBS, first released in 1999, is a reference database on transcriptional regulation in Bacillus subtilis, summarizing the experimentally characterized transcription factors, their recognition sequences and the genes they regulate. Since the previous release, the original content was extended by the addition of the data contained in 569 new publications, the total of which now reaches 947. The number of B. subtilis promoters annotated in the database was more than doubled to 1475. In addition, 463 experimentally validated B. subtilis operons and their terminators have been included. Given the increase in the number of fully sequenced bacterial genomes, we decided to extend the usability of DBTBS in comparative regulatory genomics. We therefore created a new section on the conservation of the upstream regulatory sequences between homologous genes in 40 Gram-positive bacterial species, as well as on the presence of overrepresented hexameric motifs that may have regulatory functions. DBTBS can be accessed at: http://dbtbs.hgc.jp.},

  ABSTRACT = {Multiple commercial microarrays for measuring genome-wide gene expression levels are currently available, including oligonucleotide and cDNA, single- and two-channel formats. This study reports on the results of gene expression measurements generated from identical RNA preparations that were obtained using three commercially available microarray platforms. RNA was collected from PANC-1 cells grown in serum-rich medium and at 24 h following the removal of serum. Three biological replicates were prepared for each condition, and three experimental replicates were produced for the first biological replicate. RNA was labeled and hybridized to microarrays from three major suppliers according to manufacturers' protocols, and gene expression measurements were obtained using each platform's standard software. For each platform, gene targets from a subset of 2009 common genes were compared. Correlations in gene expression levels and comparisons for significant gene expression changes in this subset were calculated, and showed considerable divergence across the different platforms, suggesting the need for establishing industrial manufacturing standards, and further independent and thorough validation of the technology.},

  ABSTRACT    = {There are many sources of systematic variation in cDNA microarray experiments which affect the measured gene expression levels (e.g. differences in labeling efficiency between the two fluorescent dyes). The term normalization refers to the process of removing such variation. A constant adjustment is often used to force the distribution of the intensity log ratios to have a median of zero for each slide. However, such global normalization approaches are not adequate in situations where dye biases can depend on spot overall intensity and/or spatial location within the array. This article proposes normalization methods that are based on robust local regression and account for intensity and spatial dependence in dye biases for different types of cDNA microarray experiments. The selection of appropriate controls for normalization is discussed and a novel set of controls (microarray sample pool, MSP) is introduced to aid in intensity-dependent normalization. Lastly, to allow for comparisons of expression levels across slides, a robust method based on maximum likelihood estimation is proposed to adjust for scale differences among slides.},

  ABSTRACT = {Increasingly large-scale expression compendia for different species are becoming available. By exploiting the modularity of the coexpression network, these compendia can be used to identify biological processes for which the expression behavior is conserved over different species. However, comparing module networks across species is not trivial. The definition of a biologically meaningful module is not a fixed one and changing the distance threshold that defines the degree of coexpression gives rise to different modules. As a result when comparing modules across species, many different partially overlapping conserved module pairs across species exist and deciding which pair is most relevant is hard. Therefore, we developed a method referred to as conserved modules across organisms (COMODO) that uses an objective selection criterium to identify conserved expression modules between two species. The method uses as input microarray data and a gene homology map and provides as output pairs of conserved modules and searches for the pair of modules for which the number of sharing homologs is statistically most significant relative to the size of the linked modules. To demonstrate its principle, we applied COMODO to study coexpression conservation between the two well-studied bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. COMODO is available at: http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/?kmarchal/Supplementary\_Information\_Zarrineh\_2010/comodo/index.html.},

  ABSTRACT    = {In Escherichia coli, the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) controls expression of the iron regulon in response to iron availability while the cyclic AMP receptor protein (Crp) regulates expression of the carbon regulon in response to carbon availability. We here identify genes subject to significant changes in expression level in response to the loss of both Fur and Crp. Many iron transport genes and several carbon metabolic genes are subject to dual control, being repressed by the loss of Crp and activated by the loss of Fur. However, the sodB gene, encoding superoxide dismutase, and the aceBAK operon, encoding the glyoxalate shunt enzymes, show the opposite responses, being activated by the loss of Crp and repressed by the loss of Fur. Several other genes including the sdhA-D, sucA-D, and fumA genes, encoding key constituents of the Krebs cycle, proved to be repressed by the loss of both transcription factors. Finally, the loss of both Crp and Fur activated a heterogeneous group of genes under sigmaS control encoding, for example, the cyclopropane fatty acid synthase, Cfa, the glycogen synthesis protein, GlgS, the 30S ribosomal protein, S22, and the mechanosensitive channel protein, YggB. Many genes appeared to be regulated by the two transcription factors in an apparently additive fashion, but apparent positive or negative cooperativity characterized several putative Crp/Fur interactions. Relevant published data were evaluated, putative Crp and Fur binding sites were identified, and representative results were confirmed by real-time PCR. Molecular explanations for some, but not all, of these effects are provided.},

  ABSTRACT = {A major challenge in microarray design is the selection of highly specific oligonucleotide probes for all targeted genes of interest, while maintaining thermodynamic uniformity at the hybridization temperature. We introduce a novel microarray design framework (Thermodynamic Model-based Oligo Design Optimizer, TherMODO) that for the first time incorporates a number of advanced modelling features: (i) A model of position-dependent labelling effects that is quantitatively derived from experiment. (ii) Multi-state thermodynamic hybridization models of probe binding behaviour, including potential cross-hybridization reactions. (iii) A fast calibrated sequence-similarity-based heuristic for cross-hybridization prediction supporting large-scale designs. (iv) A novel compound score formulation for the integrated assessment of multiple probe design objectives. In contrast to a greedy search for probes meeting parameter thresholds, this approach permits an optimization at the probe set level and facilitates the selection of highly specific probe candidates while maintaining probe set uniformity. (v) Lastly, a flexible target grouping structure allows easy adaptation of the pipeline to a variety of microarray application scenarios. The algorithm and features are discussed and demonstrated on actual design runs. Source code is available on request.},

  ABSTRACT = {There is a substantial interest in implementing bioinformatics technologies that allow the design of oligonucleotides to support the development of microarrays made from short synthetic DNA fragments spotted or in situ synthesized on slides. Ideally, such oligonucleotides should be totally specific to their respective targets to avoid any cross-hybridization and should not form stable secondary structures that may interfere with the labeled probes during hybridization. We have developed OligoArray 2.0, a program that designs specific oligonucleotides at the genomic scale. It uses a thermodynamic approach to predict secondary structures and to calculate the specificity of targets on chips for a unique probe in a mixture of labeled probes. Furthermore, OligoArray 2.0 can adjust the oligonucleotide length, according to user input, to fit a narrow T(m) range compatible with hybridization requirements. Combined with on chip oligonucleotide synthesis, this program makes it feasible to perform expression analysis on a genomic scale for any organism for which the genome sequence is known. This is without relying on cDNA or oligonucleotide libraries. OligoArray 2.0 was used to design 75 764 oligonucleotides representing 26 140 transcripts from Arabidopsis thaliana. Among this set, we provide at least one specific oligonucleotide for 93\% of these transcripts.},

  ABSTRACT = {A transcript analysis of the citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase genes (gltA-sdhCDAB) of Escherichia coli was done by nuclease S1 mapping. Evidence was obtained for two monocistronic gltA transcripts extending anti-clockwise, to a common terminus, from independent promoters with start points 196 bp (major) and 299 bp (minor) upstream of the gltA coding region. Evidence was also obtained for two polycistronic sdh transcripts, sdhCDAB (minor) and sdhDAB (major), extending clockwise, from sites 219 bp upstream of sdhC and 1455 bp upstream of sdhD (i.e. within sdhC), to a common terminus. The synthesis of all of the transcripts was repressed by growth in the presence of glucose, and this is consistent with the well-established fact that both enzymes are subject to catabolite repression. Sequences resembling known binding sites for the cAMP-CRP (cyclic AMP-cyclicAMP receptor protein) complex occur in the vicinity of each promoter suggesting that they are activated by the cAMP-CRP complex.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Computational de novo discovery of transcription factor binding sites is still a challenging problem. The growing number of sequenced genomes allows integrating orthology evidence with coregulation information when searching for motifs. Moreover, the more advanced motif detection algorithms explicitly model the phylogenetic relatedness between the orthologous input sequences and thus should be well adapted towards using orthologous information. In this study, we evaluated the conditions under which complementing coregulation with orthologous information improves motif detection for the class of probabilistic motif detection algorithms with an explicit evolutionary model. METHODOLOGY: We designed datasets (real and synthetic) covering different degrees of coregulation and orthologous information to test how well Phylogibbs and Phylogenetic sampler, as representatives of the motif detection algorithms with evolutionary model performed as compared to MEME, a more classical motif detection algorithm that treats orthologs independently. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Under certain conditions detecting motifs in the combined coregulation-orthology space is indeed more efficient than using each space separately, but this is not always the case. Moreover, the difference in success rate between the advanced algorithms and MEME is still marginal. The success rate of motif detection depends on the complex interplay between the added information and the specificities of the applied algorithms. Insights in this relation provide information useful to both developers and users. All benchmark datasets are available at http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/\~{}kmarchal/Supplementary\_Storms\_Valerie\_PlosONE.},

@ARTICLE{Touati2000,
  ABSTRACT    = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced as an inescapable consequence of aerobic life. Their levels are kept low enough to be harmless by specific enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, which eliminate them. Expression of these defence enzymes is modulated depending on the environmental oxidative threat. This basic protection, however, is not sufficient to protect against sudden large increases in ROS production. To cope with oxidative stress, rapid global responses are induced that enable bacteria to survive the stress period by multiple means: elimination of ROS, repair of oxidative damage, bypass of damaged functions and induction of adapted metabolism. The soxRS response, which protects against superoxide (O2.-)-generating agents and nitric oxide (.NO), is triggered by activation of a sensor molecule, SoxR, containing two essential [2Fe-2S] clusters. The soxRS regulon is induced in a two-stage process. Upon activation, SoxR induces soxS expression and SoxS, in turn, activates transcription of genes of the regulon. The mechanism of signalling has been under debate for years. Evidence for several pathways of SoxR activation, mediated by the modifications of [2Fe-2S] centres, has emerged from recent data. The direct oxidation of [2Fe-2S] centres, any event that may interfere with the pathway maintaining SoxR in a reduced inactive form, and direct nitrosylation by .NO can trigger SoxR activation. The multiple possibilities for SoxR activation, along with signal amplification via the two-stage process, constitute a unique, and particularly sensitive, system enabling cells to induce rapidly a protective response to a broad range of environmental changes indicative of possible oxidative stress.},

  ABSTRACT = {We examined the genomewide transcriptional responses of Escherichia coli treated with nitrosylated glutathione or the nitric oxide (NO)-generator acidified sodium nitrite (NaNO(2)) during aerobic growth. These assays showed that NorR, a homolog of NO-responsive transcription factors in Ralstonia eutrophus, and Fur, the global repressor of ferric ion uptake, are major regulators of the response to reactive nitrogen species. In contrast, SoxR and OxyR, regulators of the E. coli defenses against superoxide-generating compounds and hydrogen peroxide, respectively, have minor roles. Moreover, additional regulators of the E. coli response to reactive nitrogen species remain to be identified because several of the induced genes were regulated normally in norR, fur, soxRS, and oxyR mutant strains. We propose that the E. coli transcriptional response to reactive nitrogen species is a composite response mediated by the modification of multiple transcription factors containing iron or redox-active cysteines, some specifically designed to sense NO and its derivatives and others that are collaterally activated by the reactive nitrogen species.},

  ABSTRACT = {The succinyl-CoA synthetase of Escherichia coli is encoded by two genes, sucC (beta subunit) and sucD (alpha subunit), which are distal genes in the sucABCD operon. They are expressed from the suc promoter, which also expresses the dehydrogenase and dihydrolipoyl succinyl-transferase subunits of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Strategies have now been devised for the site-directed mutagenesis and independent expression of the succinyl-CoA synthetase (alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer) and the individual subunits. These involve (1) subcloning a promoterless sucCD fragment downstream of the lac promoter in M13mp10, and (2) precise splicing of the suc coding regions with the efficient atpE ribosome-binding site and expression from the thermoinducible lambda promoters in the pJLA503 vector. Succinyl-CoA synthetase specific activities were amplified 40-60-fold within 5 h of thermoinduction of the lambda promoters, and the alpha and beta subunits accounted for almost 30\% of the protein in supernatant fractions of the cell-free extracts. Site-directed mutagenesis of potential CoA binding-site residues indicated that Trp-43 beta and His-50 beta are essential residues in the beta-subunit, whereas Cys-47 beta could be replaced by serine without inactivating the enzyme. No activity was detected after the histidine residue at the phosphorylation site of the alpha-subunit was replaced by aspartate (His-246 alpha----Asp), but this alteration seemed to have a deleterious effect on the accumulation of the enzyme in cell-free supernatant extracts. The nucleotide sequence of an unidentified gene (g30) that is adjacent to the sucABCD operon was defined by extending the sequence of the citric acid cycle gene cluster by 818 bp to 13379 bp: gltA-sdhCDAB-sucABCD-g30. This gene converges on the suc operon and encodes a product (P30) that contains 230 amino acids (Mr 27,251). Highly significant similarities were detected between the N-terminal region of P30 and those of GENA [the product of another unidentified gene (geneA) located upstream of the aceEF-lpd operon], and GNTR (a putative transcriptional repressor of the gluconate operon of Bacillus subtilis). Possible roles for GENA and P30 as transcriptional regulators of the adjacent operons encoding the pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes are discussed.},

  ABSTRACT    = {The availability of completely sequenced genomes and the wealth of literature on gene regulation have enabled researchers to model the transcriptional regulation system of some organisms in the form of a network. In order to reconstruct such networks in non-model organisms, three principal approaches have been taken. First, one can transfer the interactions between homologous components from a model organism to the organism of interest. Second, microarray experiments can be used to detect patterns in gene expression that stem from regulatory interactions. Finally, knowledge of experimentally characterized transcription factor binding sites can be used to analyze the promoter sequences in a genome in order to identify potential binding sites. In this chapter, we will focus in detail on the first approach and describe methods to reconstruct and analyze the transcriptional regulatory networks of uncharacterized organisms by using a known regulatory network as a template.},

  ABSTRACT = {Machine learning approaches offer the potential to systematically identify transcriptional regulatory interactions from a compendium of microarray expression profiles. However, experimental validation of the performance of these methods at the genome scale has remained elusive. Here we assess the global performance of four existing classes of inference algorithms using 445 Escherichia coli Affymetrix arrays and 3,216 known E. coli regulatory interactions from RegulonDB. We also developed and applied the context likelihood of relatedness (CLR) algorithm, a novel extension of the relevance networks class of algorithms. CLR demonstrates an average precision gain of 36\% relative to the next-best performing algorithm. At a 60\% true positive rate, CLR identifies 1,079 regulatory interactions, of which 338 were in the previously known network and 741 were novel predictions. We tested the predicted interactions for three transcription factors with chromatin immunoprecipitation, confirming 21 novel interactions and verifying our RegulonDB-based performance estimates. CLR also identified a regulatory link providing central metabolic control of iron transport, which we confirmed with real-time quantitative PCR. The compendium of expression data compiled in this study, coupled with RegulonDB, provides a valuable model system for further improvement of network inference algorithms using experimental data.},

ArcA is able to bind in vitro in the absence of the in vivo triggering signal. The binding occurs in one step and study of contacts within the operator sequence reveals binding on one side of the double helix. The DNA protection extends to a much larger region (about 65 bp) than would be expected for a 27 kDa protein, suggesting polymerization. Both Fur and ArcA footprints encompass the -35 and -10 promoter region and there is considerable overlap of their binding sequences, in agreement with in vivo results suggesting that either regulator alone can block sodA transcription. Furthermore, competition experiments show that Fur and ArcA binding to the sodA promoter are mutually exclusive and that ArcA can easily displace Fur, but not vice versa. The biological significance of this in vitro behaviour is discussed.},

It exploits in a concurrent way three independent data sources: ChIP-chip data, motif information and gene expression profiles. When compared to published module discovery algorithms, ReMoDiscovery is fast and easily tunable. We evaluated our method on yeast data, where it was shown to generate biologically meaningful findings and allowed the prediction of potential novel roles of transcriptional regulators.},

  ABSTRACT    = {In Escherichia coli K-12, transcription of zwf, the gene for glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, is subject to growth rate-dependent regulation and is activated by SoxS in response to superoxide stress. To define genetically the site of SoxS activation, we undertook a detailed deletion analysis of the zwf promoter region. Using specifically targeted 5' and 3' deletions of zwf sequences, we localized the SoxS activation site to a 21-bp region upstream of the zwf promoter. This minimal "soxbox" was able to confer paraquat inducibility when placed upstream of a normally unresponsive gnd-lacZ protein fusion. In addition, we used these findings as the basis for resecting unnecessary sequences from the region upstream of the promoters of two other SoxS-regulated genes, sodA and nfo. Like the zwf soxbox, the regions required for SoxS activation of sodA and nfo appear to lie just upstream or overlap the -35 hexamers of the corresponding promoters. Importantly, the sequence boundaries established here by deletion analysis agree with the primary SoxS recognition sites of zwf, sodA, and nfo that we previously identified in vitro by gel mobility shift and DNase I protection assays with a purified MalE-SoxS fusion protein.},

  ABSTRACT = {A central issue in molecular biology is understanding the regulatory mechanisms that control gene expression. The availability of whole genome sequences opens the way for computational methods to search for the key elements in transcription regulation. These include methods for discovering the binding sites of DNA-binding proteins, such as transcription factors. A common representation of transcription factor binding sites is a position specific score matrix (PSSM). We developed a probabilistic approach for searching for putative binding sites. Given a promoter sequence and a PSSM, we scan the promoter and find the position with the maximal score. Then we calculate the probability to get such a maximal score or higher on a random promoter. This is the p-value of the putative binding site. In this way, we searched for putative binding sites in the upstream sequences of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where some binding sites are known (according to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Promoters Database, SCPD). Our method produces either exact p-values, or a better estimate for them than other methods, and this improves the results of the search. For each gene we found its statistically significant putative binding sites. We measured the rates of true positives, by a comparison to the known binding sites, and also compared our results to these of MatInspector, a commercially available software that looks for putative binding sites in DNA sequences according to PSSMs. Our results were significantly better. In contrast with us, MatInspector doesn't calculate the exact statistical significance of its results.},

  ABSTRACT = {The BioCyc database collection is a set of 160 pathway/genome databases (PGDBs) for most eukaryotic and prokaryotic species whose genomes have been completely sequenced to date. Each PGDB in the BioCyc collection describes the genome and predicted metabolic network of a single organism, inferred from the MetaCyc database, which is a reference source on metabolic pathways from multiple organisms. In addition, each bacterial PGDB includes predicted operons for the corresponding species. The BioCyc collection provides a unique resource for computational systems biology, namely global and comparative analyses of genomes and metabolic networks, and a supplement to the BioCyc resource of curated PGDBs. The Omics viewer available through the BioCyc website allows scientists to visualize combinations of gene expression, proteomics and metabolomics data on the metabolic maps of these organisms. This paper discusses the computational methodology by which the BioCyc collection has been expanded, and presents an aggregate analysis of the collection that includes the range of number of pathways present in these organisms, and the most frequently observed pathways. We seek scientists to adopt and curate individual PGDBs within the BioCyc collection. Only by harnessing the expertise of many scientists we can hope to produce biological databases, which accurately reflect the depth and breadth of knowledge that the biomedical research community is producing.},

  ABSTRACT    = {The individual and the combined effect of the fnr and arcA regulatory gene products on cytochrome o oxidase and cytochrome d oxidase gene expression in Escherichia coli were evaluated using lacZ reporter fusions to the cyo-ABCDE and cydAB operons. Fnr repressed cyo-lacZ and cyd-lacZ expression during anaerobic growth but not during aerobic growth conditions. ArcA functioned as an anaerobic repressor of cyo-lacZ expression while, in contrast, it activated cydAB expression during both aerobic and anaerobic growth. ArcA and Fnr appear to function independently of each other to control cyo-ABCDE operon expression. In contrast, FNR repression of cydAB expression was dependent on arcA+, as indicated by the inability of fnr+ plasmids to repress cyd-lacZ expression in an arcA strain. Under no conditions tested did Fnr activate cydAB expression. Most, but not all, of the observed aerobic/anaerobic regulation of cyo and cyd was accounted for by the two transcriptional regulators. These data suggest the existence of additional levels of anaerobic gene control in E. coli. Additionally, the expression of the fnr regulatory gene, and regulation of the anaerobic respiratory genes, narGHJI, dmsABC and frdABCD, was found to be independent of ArcA.},

  ABSTRACT    = {The set of frequent closed itemsets uniquely determines the exact frequency of all itemsets, yet it can be orders of magnitude smaller than the set of all frequent itemsets. In this paper we present CHARM, an efficient algorithm for mining all frequent closed itemsets. It enumerates closed sets using a dual itemset-tidset search tree, using an efficient hybrid search that skips many levels. It also uses a technique called diffsets to reduce the memory footprint of intermediate computations. Finally it uses a fast hash-based approach to remove any non-closed sets found during computation. An extensive experimental evaluation on a number of real and synthetic databases shows that CHARM significantly outperforms previous methods. It is also linearly scalable in the number of transactions.},

  ABSTRACT    = {The ArcA and Fnr regulators of Escherichia coli, both of which are activated in anaerobic conditions, negatively regulate the sodA gene (coding for manganese superoxide dismutase), but Fnr has no effect on anaerobic sodA expression in a delta arcA delta fnr background (Compan and Touati, 1993). We show here that the sdh gene (coding for succinate dehydrogenase) is also negatively regulated by Fnr, but again Fnr exerts no control in a delta arcA background. One interpretation of these results is that Fnr activates arcA transcription. Using arcA-lac transcriptional and translational fusions, we show that arcA expression increases (about fourfold) in anaerobiosis and that both Fnr and ArcA are required for full expression. In a delta fnr background, there is no autoactivation, suggesting that ArcA enhances activation by Fnr. Transcript and sequence analyses reveal that the arcA upstream regulatory region lies within a 530 bp non-coding DNA fragment, which contains five putative promoter sequences and a putative Fnr-binding site. Identification of the transcription start sites indicates that transcription occurs in aerobiosis from three constitutive upstream promoters (Pe, Pd, Pc). In anaerobiosis an additional completely Fnr-dependent transcript starting at Pa is present; expression from Pa is reduced in the absence of ArcA, and Fnr activation at Pa blocks the weak anaerobic-dependent expression from Pb. Fnr activation of arcA transcription may play an important role in the co-ordination of expression of genes associated with aerobic and anaerobic metabolism during environmental changes.},

@ARTICLE{Ernst2008,
  ABSTRACT = {While Escherichia coli has one of the most comprehensive datasets of experimentally verified transcriptional regulatory interactions of any organism, it is still far from complete. This presents a problem when trying to combine gene expression and regulatory interactions to model transcriptional regulatory networks. Using the available regulatory interactions to predict new interactions may lead to better coverage and more accurate models. Here, we develop SEREND (SEmi-supervised REgulatory Network Discoverer), a semi-supervised learning method that uses a curated database of verified transcriptional factor-gene interactions, DNA sequence binding motifs, and a compendium of gene expression data in order to make thousands of new predictions about transcription factor-gene interactions, including whether the transcription factor activates or represses the gene. Using genome-wide binding datasets for several transcription factors, we demonstrate that our semi-supervised classification strategy improves the prediction of targets for a given transcription factor. To further demonstrate the utility of our inferred interactions, we generated a new microarray gene expression dataset for the aerobic to anaerobic shift response in E. coli. We used our inferred interactions with the verified interactions to reconstruct a dynamic regulatory network for this response. The network reconstructed when using our inferred interactions was better able to correctly identify known regulators and suggested additional activators and repressors as having important roles during the aerobic-anaerobic shift interface.},
